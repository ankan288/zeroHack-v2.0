IMMUNEFI CASE STUDIES ACKNOWLEDGMENT:

This software incorporates security research and vulnerability patterns based
on real-world case studies from the Immunefi bug bounty platform. The 
inclusion of these patterns is for educational and defensive security purposes.

Total Portfolio Value Represented: $10,660,000+
- Wormhole Proxy Vulnerability: $10,000,000 (World Record)
- Port Finance DeFi Logic Error: $630,000
- Perpetual Protocol Bad Debt: $30,000
- Additional Case Studies: 4 undisclosed values

These case studies represent some of the most significant vulnerability
discoveries in the Web3 and cryptocurrency security space. They are included
to educate security researchers and developers about real-world attack 
patterns and prevention strategies.

Special acknowledgment to the security researchers who responsibly disclosed
these vulnerabilities, particularly satya0x for the historic $10M Wormhole
disclosure that set new standards for the industry.
